In Java, methods are defined with a specific syntax that includes the return type, method name, parameters (if any), and the method body. Here’s how you define a method with a return type and where the return statement typically appears as the last statement within the method body:
Method Definition Syntax

java

returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // method body
    // other statements
    return value; // return statement
}

Explanation

    returnType: This specifies the type of value that the method will return after it executes. It can be any valid Java data type (primitive or object).

    methodName: This is the name of the method which uniquely identifies it within its class.

    parameters: These are optional. They specify the type and number of parameters that the method accepts. Parameters are enclosed in parentheses ().

    Method Body: This is enclosed in curly braces {} and contains the code that defines what the method does.

    return value: This is the statement that returns a value of the specified type from the method to the calling code. The return keyword is followed by the value to be returned.

Example

Let’s consider a simple example where we have a method addNumbers that adds two integers and returns the result:

java

public class Example {
    
    public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
        int sum = a + b;
        return sum; // Return statement
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = addNumbers(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}

    Method: addNumbers is a static method that takes two integer parameters (int a and int b).
    Method Body: It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the sum variable.
    Return Statement: The return sum; statement returns the calculated sum back to the caller (in this case, the main method).
    Calling the Method: In the main method, addNumbers(5, 3) is called, and the returned value (8) is stored in result, which is then printed.
